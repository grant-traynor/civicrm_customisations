civicrm_customisations
======================

Customisations to CiviCRM for AA specific layouts, templates, etc.

1. Added a customisation to template /CRM/Contact/Page/ContactImage.tpl to set the
   image width to "auto" to stop images squashing / distorting when they don't match
   default template dimensions.
